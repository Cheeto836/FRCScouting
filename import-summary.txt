ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* Class Diagram.png
* Class Diagram.ucls
* FRC_Scouting_Server/
* FRC_Scouting_Server/README.txt
* FRC_Scouting_Server/populate_event_list.php
* FRC_Scouting_Server/populate_robot_pics.php
* FRC_Scouting_Server/scouting-header.php
* FRC_Scouting_Server/scouting.php
* FRC_Scouting_Server/scouting.sql
* GenerateContract.sh
* LICENSE
* README.md
* Release Steps.txt
* SQLITEContractGen.py
* VersionUpdate.py
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/achartengine-1.0.0.jar => app/libs/achartengine-1.0.0.jar
* libs/android-support-v13.jar => app/libs/android-support-v13.jar
* lint.xml => app/lint.xml
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* atote.PNG => atote.png
* bin.PNG => bin.png
* ytotes.PNG => ytotes.png

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
